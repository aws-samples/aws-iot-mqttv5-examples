# AWS IoT MQTTv5 Examples

This repository contains example Python scripts to experiment with AWS IoT MQTTv5 features. Please check [Introducing new MQTTv5 features for AWS IoT Core to help build flexible architecture patterns](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/introducing-new-mqttv5-features-for-aws-iot-core-to-help-build-flexible-architecture-patterns/) blog post for use cases and recommended architecture patterns of examples.

You need to create AWS IoT client certificates and place them to `certificates` folder to be able to run these experiments on your AWS account. The folder is currently empty, refer to [Create AWS IoT client certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-certs-create.html) documentation page or the blog post content to learn more.
